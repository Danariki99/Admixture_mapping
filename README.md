ADMIXTURE MAPPING PROJECT

abstract:
In recent years, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing projects have identified over 70,000 associations between genetic variants and human traits or diseases. However, the majority of these studies rely on participants from European ancestry dominated biobanks, limiting insights into the full spectrum of human genetic diversity and its impact on disease. Admixture mapping offers a complementary approach to GWAS by leveraging differences in disease prevalence across ancestral populations to identify risk loci for complex traits. Here, we present an extension of the snputils software suite to perform admixture mapping analysis at a large scale. We used this approach to analyze large-scale GWAS cohorts, namely the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program datasets, and studied associations between local ancestry and a total of 172 phenotypes. Our method not only replicates previously reported associations but also identifies novel loci with important implications for human disease. Additionally, we incorporate a fine-mapping strategy within the 31 identified regions, allowing us to genetically pinpoint the signal in 26 cases. Our findings highlight key genetic markers by considering local ancestry and quantifying their contribution to trait variability.
